        <p class="event-description">
            The AI4GOOD event brought together several schools and universities from across Mauritius. The competition aimed to use AI to create videos from passages and poems taken from various selected writers. Participants were required to read and interpret these literary works creatively using only AI tools. It was a challenging yet exciting event that saw students put their AI skills to the test. <br><br>
            The efforts of all the participating teams were commendable, and the Université des Mascareignes (UdM) truly stood out by clinching the top three positions in the 19-25 age category. The winners were:
            <ul>
                <li>1st Prize: Team A - UdM</li>
                <li>2nd Prize: Team B - UdM</li>
                <li>3rd Prize: Team C - UdM</li>
            </ul>
            The AI4GOOD initiative is a testament to how technology can merge creativity and innovation, offering students the platform to showcase their skills in an AI-driven world.
